# BikeshareUS
This Project was part of Udacity Nanodegree program for data analysis

In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems in the US. 
Using a code to import the data and answer questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
Also with writing a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
